# minimig-de1


## Description

This is a port of minimig to the [Altera DE1 board](http://www.altera.com/education/univ/materials/boards/de1/unv-de1-board.html).

[minimig](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimig) (short for Mini Amiga) is an open source re-implementation of an Amiga 500 using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Original minimig author is Dennis van Weeren.

[Amiga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_500) was (in my opinion) an amazing personal computer, announced around 1987, which - at the time - far surpassed any other personal computer on the market, with advanced graphic & sound capabilities.

This port is based on work done by tobiflexx, who did the original hard work of porting minimig to the Altera boards. His sources are published on [minimigtg68](http://gamesource.groups.yahoo.com/group/minimigtg68) Yahoo Group. He is also the author of the tg68 Motorola 68000 softcore CPU, published on [opencores](http://opencores.org/project,tg68).

Original minimig sources with updates from yaqube (and possibly others) are published on [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/minimig/).

Some updates are from user boing4000 from the Minimig forum.
